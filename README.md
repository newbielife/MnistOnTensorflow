# MnistOnTensorflow
TensorFlow is used to build a neural network to solve the problem of MNIST handwritten numeral recognition. This neural network USES the activation function to delinearize, which is itself a three-layer all-connection structure, learning rate with exponential decay and L2 regularization loss function.
